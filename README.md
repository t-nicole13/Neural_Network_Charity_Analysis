# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Objective
For this project, I used neural networks to create a binary classifer that will predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by the investment company, Alphabet Soup.  

Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy overtime.   The structure mimics the way human biological neurons signal to one another.  

### Tasks
- Preprocess data for a neural network model
- Compile, train, and evaluate the model
- Optimize the model

## Resources

### Tools/Languages
- TensorFlow 2.8.0
- Visual Studio Code 1.66.1
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
- Scikit-Learn 1.0.2
- Pandas 1.3.4

### Data
- charity_data.csv (Contains information on organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup)
